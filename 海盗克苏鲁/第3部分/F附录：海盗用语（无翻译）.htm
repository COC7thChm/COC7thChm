<LI>All Sails Speed – Putting every bit of canvas on the ship into the sails, usually in a last-ditch effort to get away from a faster ship and certain death.Or possibly to catch that small fast boat that keeps slipping away.This is dangerous, as it can put too much strain on the ship’s masts.One wrong move can result in a broken yard arm, or worse.A corsair should consider the consequences before going to All Sails.</LI>

<P>o Bow and aft chasers.These are cannons on either the front (bow) or aft (rear) of the ship, to shoot at ships running away or in pursuit.These are usually also balanced except for extremely large ships which</P>
<P>do not worry with aft chaser cannons.</P>
<P>o Swivel guns: These small cannons are usually mounted at the center line of the ship, or on the quarterdeck.They have much more freedom to aim than other cannons with a usual swivel range of 180 degrees.</P>
